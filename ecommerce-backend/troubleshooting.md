## Troubleshooting Steps
AI generates different code each time so you might run into different problems than me.<br>
Here's what to do:

## Copy-Paste the Error Into the AI
1. If you encounter an error, for example.<br>
<img height="200" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62230d54-07bd-43bd-897d-815e09cc1916" />

2. Copy-paste the error directly into the AI and ask what it means.<br>

3. If the AI responds and you don't understand something, ask it for more details.<br>

4. You can also just ask the AI to try and fix the error. Review the changes it made and see if the changes make sense.<br>

5. For the best learning experience, it's better to ask the AI about the error first and try to understand what it means. Then ask the AI to fix it.

## Still Have Issues? Download My Code
If you still cannot fix the issue, you can download a copy of my code and start from there.

1. Open this link: https://github.com/SuperSimpleDev/ecommerce-backend-ai/commits/main/. This will give you a list of Git Commits I made in the video.

2. In the video, go backwards and find the most recent Commit I made (before you ran into your issue).

3. Find the Commit in the list of Git Commits and click "Browse repository at this point"<br>
<img height="200" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bbd3861-d8a9-4a24-8580-1510e8d6e5f3" />

4. This will open the code at that Commit (at that point in time). Click `Code` > `Download ZIP`.<br>

5. Stop any other backends running on port 3000 (find the command line the other backend is running in and press Ctrl + C).

6. Unzip the code you downloaded earlier and open the folder in VSCode.

7. Open the Command Line by clicking `Terminal` > `New Terminal`.

8. Run `npm install`, and run `node server.js`. Now you can start from this Commit in the video.
